#' Compare distances of nearest kanji
#'
#' List distances to nearest neighbors of a given kanji in terms of a reference distance
#' (which is currently only the stroke edit distance) and compare with values in terms of
#' another distance (currently only the kanji distance).
#'
#' @param kan a kanji (currently only as a single UTF-8 character).
#' @param refdist the name of the reference distance (currently only "strokedit").
#' @param refnn the number of nearest neighbors in terms of the reference distance.
#' @param compdist a character vector. The name(s) of one or several other distances to compare with
#' (currently only "kanjidist").
#' @param compnn the number of nearest neighbors in terms of the other distance(s).
#' @param kvecdata a list of the 2136 Jouyou kanji in [`kanjivec`] format, as obtained e.g. from
#' <https://github.com/dschuhmacher/kanjistat.data>.
#' @param ... further parameters that are passed to [kanjidist()].

#' `r lifecycle::badge("experimental")`\cr
#' This is only a first draft of the function and its interface and details may change considerably in the future.
#' As there is currently no precomputed kanjidist matrix, there is a huge difference in computation time between
#' setting `compnn = 0` (only kanji distances to the `refnn` nearest neighbors in terms of `refdist` have to be 
#' computed) and setting `compnn` to any value $> 0$ (kanji distances to all 2135 other Jouyou kanji have to be
#' computed in order to determine the `compnn` nearest neighbors; depending on the system and parameter settings
#' this can take (roughly) anywhere between 2 minutes and an hour).
#'
#' @return A matrix of distances with `refnn + compnn` columns named by the nearest neighbors of `kan` (first
#' in terms of the reference distance, then the other distances) and `1 + length(compdist)` rows named
#' by the type of distance.
